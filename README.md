## Prerequisites

* Node
* NPM / Yarn

## Getting started

* run `yarn` or `npm i`

## Running the build

There are two kinds: case and assignment.

### Case

You can use the case as input to setup the ITCSS architecture. Alternatively, you can use code from your own codebase.

* run `yarn build:case` or `npm run build:case` to run the build for the case.
* run `open src/1_case/index.html` to open the page in your default browser.

### Assignment

You can use the assignment as a clean slate to build your page using ITCSS.

* run `yarn build:assignment` or `npm run build:assignment` to run the build for the assignment.
* run `open src/1_assignment/index.html` to open the page in your default browser.
